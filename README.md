# SF-BBCSO-Pro-Articulation
Spitfire BBCSO Pro Articulation files for Logic Pro X

The included files are for use in Logic Pro X when using the BBC Symphony Orchestra samples by Spitfire Audio (https://www.spitfireaudio.com/bbcso/)

To install, please copy the files into the Articulation Folder

User/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings

They can be stored in a folder here for better organisation alongside other articulation set.

The only thing to be aware of is due to a personal preferance, I have swapped the Long and Legato articulations over so that Long is the defult. I find this the best for me when working, although it can be changed quatie easily withing the articulation set edit menu.

This map was uploaded 15/04/2021 and I hope to add to it soon with the Core and Discovery maps
