# SF-BBCSO-Pro-Articulation
Spitfire BBCSO Pro and Core Articulation files for Logic Pro X

The included files are for use in Logic Pro X when using the BBC Symphony Orchestra samples by Spitfire Audio (https://www.spitfireaudio.com/bbcso/). I Have incliuded the files for all the Pro instruments, most of which also apear in the Core. With percussion, there is no 'untuned percussion' as the instrumnts used are all different and not seperate articulations. I recomend setting each to a seperate track.

To install, please copy the files into the Articulation Folder

User/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings

They can be stored in a further folder here for better organisation alongside other articulation set.

The only thing to be aware of is due to a personal preferance, I have swapped the Long and Legato articulations over so that Long is the defult. I find this the best for me when working, although it can be changed quite easily withing the articulation set edit menu.
